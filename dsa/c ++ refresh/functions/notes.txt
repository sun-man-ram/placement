functions are also called as modules 
generally everything is going inot main function.writing all in main function is not 
good style of programming we break this into smaller tasks 

see photo screenshot

everything inside main is callled monolithic programming
breaking down into function and writing is called modular programming


how to write a function :)
function int add(int a,int b){ //formal parameters
int c;
c-a+b;
return c;
}

//actual parameters
