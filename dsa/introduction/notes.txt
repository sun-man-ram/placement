data is an integral part of your program
program is nothing but set of instruction to perform over data 
the word data is used in many places like data structure data  ware house data cleaning big data 

introduction to data sructure
arrangement of data in a fasion where operations on data can be done efficiently 
data is kept in main memory :)
during the execution of program both program and data need to in main memory not in hdd

dataBases
how this data is arranging in some model like relational in permanent is called dataBases

dataStructure is arranging this in main memory 
operationla data can be used daily legacy data is like historical data can 
be kept away of the disc this is data ware house :)

understand memory 

the memory is divided into smaller dividable units called bytes.every byte is having its address
see (4).png  

if in memory i have large ram like 4 gb or 8 gb entire is not used they are divided into segment called 64 kb



how our program uses main memory 

see (5).png
see (6).png

static memory allocation through program how many bytes of memory is required is decided at compiler time :)
that is static memory allocation

what is activation record or stack frame of main function

the activation records are created like this so the fadhion is called stack :)

what is heap ?

heap is used in two cases if it is organised in tower like thing 
heap is used in unorganised thing 


stack memory is organised but heap here is unorganised :)

heap memory is like resource


programs cannot access heap memory 

using pointer only it can access heap memory
